# Calculator

A calculator using Javascript that can do basic calculations (two values with one operation).

Works with button presses or keyboard input. Has no handling for any input beyond (value 1) (operator) (value 2) (equals).

To do:
 - Add functionality for more than 2 values (if user has already selected an operator and 2 values, the calculation will be run, then value 1 will equal the outcome)
