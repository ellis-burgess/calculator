# Calculator

A calculator using Javascript that can do basic calculations (two values with one operation).

Works with button presses or keyboard input. Has no handline for any input beyond (value 1) (operator) (value 2) (equals).

To do:
 - Add functionality for operator press with no digits entered (if operator is selected without any input, default to 0 or use the outcome of the previous calculation)
 - Add functionality for more than 2 values (if user has already selected an operator and 2 values, the calculation will be run, then value 1 will equal the outcome)
